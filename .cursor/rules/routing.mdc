# Routing Rules

## Directory Structure
- All routes must use directory-based routing with @react-router/fs-routes
- Route files must be named `route.tsx` within their respective directories
- Example structure:
  ✅ app/routes/admin.products._index/route.tsx
  ❌ app/routes/admin.products._index.tsx

## Component Naming
- Default export in route files must be named `PageComponent`
- Example:
  ```tsx
  export default function PageComponent() {
    return <div>Page Content</div>
  }
  ```

## URL Handling
- All URLs must use absolute paths when applicable
- Use react-router@7.1.5 framework mode (docs: https://reactrouter.com/home)
- Don't import from @remix-run/react or react-router-dom
