# Code Style Rules

## Function Definitions
- Prefer inline function definitions in component props when used only once
  ✅ <button onClick={() => handleClick()}>
  ❌ const handleClick = () => {}; ... <button onClick={handleClick}>

## Effects and Actions
- Avoid using `useEffect`
- If an action should be called, call it while the related event is running
- Example:
  ✅ <button onClick={() => fetchData()}>
  ❌ useEffect(() => { fetchData() }, [])

## Form Handling
- Use react-hook-form@7.54.2 with @hookform/resolvers
- Use zod@3.24.2 for form validation

## Component Organization
- Define components within the same file if they're not shared
- Place shared components in the same directory as their primary usage

## Library Usage
- Before implementing any functionality, check and recommend suitable libraries first
