description: How code should be write conventionally
globs: 
---
- It's a react-router project with @react-router/fs-routes, all url should be defined using directory name and actual file for the page should be route.tsx in that directory.
    - For exmaple, app/routes/admin.products._index/route.tsx instead of app/routes/admin.products._index.tsx
- default export of a route.tsx should be named PageComponent
- Prefer defining components, functions, utils withing same file that using it if those are not mean to be shared in other places. Secondly, place those in the same directory.
- Prefer putting related resources like scss, images in the same directory of a page.
- Don't import from @remix-run/react or react-router-dom, I'm using react-router@7.1.5
- Prefer inline function definitions directly in component props when the function is only used once, rather than defining separate functions and passing them as references
- Always refer to package.json for what tech is used and how packages should be imported.
- Prefer not to use Barrel File and not to re-export with *.
- All url should be absolute path if applicable
- Better not use `useEffect`, if an action should be called, call it while the related event is running.
